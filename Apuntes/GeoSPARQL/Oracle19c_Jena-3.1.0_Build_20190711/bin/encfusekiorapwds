# Unix shell script for invoking oracle.spatial.rdf.client.jena.utilities.EncryptFusekiOraPwds

# Utility program to encrypt clear text Oracle dataset passwords defined with jdbc url parameters in Apache Jena Fuseki configuration file. 
# To encrypt the password add a '!' character at the beginning of the password name and execute this program.
# 
# For example:
# 
# oracle:connection
# [ a oracle:OracleConnection ;
#     oracle:jdbcURL "jdbc:oracle:thin:@(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=127.0.0.1)(PORT=1521))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVER=DEDICATED)(SERVICE_NAME=srvc)))";
#    oracle:User "scott";
#    oracle:Password "!tiger"
# ];
# 
# The input configuration file will be rewritten with passwords encrypted (a backup copy of original file will be generated). 
# Then copy the new configuation file into Fuseki configuration directory and start or restart Fuseki if already running.
 
# Example usage:
# encfusekiorapwds /tmp/config.ttl

# make sure $ORACLE_JENA_HOME is set
if [ -z "$ORACLE_JENA_HOME" ]; then
  echo "ORACLE_JENA_HOME environment variable is not set"
  exit 1
fi

# environment is set - do the load
java -cp $ORACLE_JENA_HOME/jar/'*' oracle.spatial.rdf.client.jena.utilities.EncryptFusekiOraPwds "$@"

exit 0
